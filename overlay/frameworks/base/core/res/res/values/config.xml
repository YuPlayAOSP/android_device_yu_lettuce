    <!-- Minimum allowable screen brightness to use in a very dark room.
         This value sets the floor for the darkest possible auto-brightness
         adjustment.  It is expected to be somewhat less than the first entry in
         config_autoBrightnessLcdBacklightValues so as to allow the user to have
         some range of adjustment to dim the screen further than usual in very
         dark rooms. The contents of the screen must still be clearly visible
         in darkness (although they may not be visible in a bright room). -->

    <!-- Array of light sensor LUX values to define our levels for auto backlight brightness support.
         The N entries of this array define N + 1 control points as follows:
         (1-based arrays)

         Point 1:            (0, value[1]):             lux <= 0
         Point 2:     (level[1], value[2]):  0        < lux <= level[1]
         Point 3:     (level[2], value[3]):  level[2] < lux <= level[3]
         ...
         Point N+1: (level[N], value[N+1]):  level[N] < lux

         The control points must be strictly increasing.  Each control point
         corresponds to an entry in the brightness backlight values arrays.
         For example, if LUX == level[1] (first element of the levels array)
         then the brightness will be determined by value[2] (second element
         of the brightness values array).

         Spline interpolation is used to determine the auto-brightness
         backlight values for LUX levels between these control points.
